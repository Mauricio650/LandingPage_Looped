## ⚙️ Installation and usage

- You must install a extension for VSC called axe Accessibility Linter

>  🧩 Note: The “axe Accessibility Linter” extension for VS Code helps developers detect accessibility issues in their HTML, JSX, or other UI code while coding, before the app even runs in the browser.

## 🧠 What it does:

It analyzes your code and warns you about accessibility problems — for example:

- Missing alt attributes on images.
- Low color contrast between text and background.
- Missing labels on form inputs.
- Wrong heading order h1, h2, etc.
- ARIA attributes used incorrectly.

## ⚙️ How it works:

- It runs automatically when you save your file.
- You’ll see linting warnings or errors in VS Code (like ESLint does).
- Each issue includes a description and a link to learn how to fix it (based on Deque’s axe-core, the same library used by professional accessibility testers).

## ✅ Why it’s useful:

It helps you make your web apps accessible to everyone — including users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader users).
It also helps improve SEO and compliance with standards like WCAG and ADA.

## 🔥 After that just execute this code

 ```bash
 pnpm install
 ```

You'll got a perfect initial project for begin to code with some needed configurations like a prettier, rules for typescript's linter and axe Accessibility Linter.´
